We have 100 boxes.
These boxes are lined up side by side.
We have a rabbit in one of these boxes.
We don't know which box the rabbit is in.
We want to find the rabbit.
We can check one box at a time.
While we are checking which box the rabbit is in, the rabbit jumps forward or backward.
However, this is random and we do not know where the rabbit jumps.
When it reaches the last box or the first box, it must go 1 step before the point it came to since it cannot go any further.
It leaves no trace behind.
We want to catch this rabbit.
To catch the rabbit, we have to check the box in which the rabbit jumped. Not the box it's in!
How do we catch this rabbit?
